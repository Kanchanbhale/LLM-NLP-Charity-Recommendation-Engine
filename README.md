Social Responsibility is a fundamental necessity in today’s world to fight social-evils.
When it comes to Charity Donations, users face a lack of motivation due to the
process being difficult and tedious. 
<br> There is an unavailability of a one-stop platform where users can get recommendations of multiple trusted Charities based on
articles read by them online. As for NGOs, there is a need of expanding their reach
and influence.

The Recommendation Engine takes Web-Articles as input, pre-processes the raw
text data using Natural Language Processing. For Classification, we have tested 5
different algorithms- Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines,
Stochastic Gradient Descent and Random Forest algorithms. It then predicts the
Social Cause highlighted in the article and recommends top 3 charities based on
the predicted cause and various other metrics like user-ratings, financial-ratings,
etc. This Recommendation Engine is integrated with a Web-Application built using
Streamlit, an open-source Python framework. Streamlit builds tunnel websites that
can be accessed as long as the Python Notebook runs online.

The scope of this project can be extended to provide User Customization based on
location in order to assist the local NGOs with more exposure. Recommendations
based on previous donations can also be provided. The developed Web-Application
can be used to build a Web-Browser plugin, in the future.

> Future Scope 
1. CustomizationCustomization to users can be provided based on their preferences, locations, etc.
This will not only give better results but will also help local charities in expanding their
reach in neighbouring regions.
2. Integrating the AI model with a Browser extension/AppThis will provide a better User Experience and make donating to users’ choice of
charity easier and more convenient. Developing an Android Application or a Web
Plugin for the model will minimize effort for the user, thus maximizing the number of
net donations made.
3. User ExperienceThis can be improved by modifying the Web-App / Browser Plugin. Better visuals as
well as User Interface can be provided.
4. Recommendations based on previous donationsThis can be provided to increase number of donations and help more NGOs supporting
similar social causes.
